# BattleBoard

This will be a full-stack web application which allows people to create boards for tournaments, allowing users to pair off competitors and easily display the current state of the competition as well as a place to archive past tournaments.

## Roadmap

1. Allow a user to create a board, and manage it as it updates in real time, and allowing that user to share a link to their board that anyone can use to stay up to date on tournament results. These are the basic features I am looking to implement.

> Add participants quickly, and allow the organizer to randomly create the matchups

> Allow organizer to drag and drop matchups intentionally if they need certain people to face certain people. This should also allow the organizer to create some matchups and let the rest fill automatically.

> Allow organizer 

2. Different styles of tournament boards.

> True tournament bracket, so winners face winners

> Tournament bracket with losers bracket

3. Qualify of Life improvements that would give a sense of attachment to using the board

> Allow participants to register users, so their nameplates can render things like avatars and profile information and speed up the registration process

> Allow board organizers to customize the look of their board
